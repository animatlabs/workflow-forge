# WorkflowForge

> High-performance, zero-dependency workflow orchestration framework for .NET with microsecond-level execution and minimal memory footprint. Uses an industrial metaphor (Forge, Foundry, Smith, Operations) for building workflows.

## About

WorkflowForge is an open-source .NET library for building high-performance workflows with a clean, fluent API. It provides built-in compensation (saga pattern): override RestoreAsync in your operation to support rollback; the base class provides a no-op default — operations that don't override it are safely skipped during compensation. Lifecycle hooks and a comprehensive extension ecosystem with zero version conflicts.
